Air Traffic Control Game
This is an air traffic control game in which user is the air traffic controller whose
goal is to have planes land and takeoff safely, as efficiently as possible. The
game ends whenever a plane crashes, or all of the planes have managed to land
and takeoff safely.

Next we will go the operating instructions to make sure that the airport can be
operated safely. In the center of the screen, there will be a map to view the
airport; it contains lots of useful information for safe operation. One must be
quick, but most importantly safe since only a single mistake can end the game!

AIRPLANES
The plane cards (found on the left sidebar) contain information on arriving and
departing airplanes. Don't let a plane run out of fuel in the air, or land on
a too short runway!

RUNWAYS
The runway cards include lots of useful information on the runway.
Departing and arriving planes can only be seen on the map. The queue shows
currently queueing airplanes and planes taxiing to the queue. If there's the letter
"T" in front of the planes name, it means the plane is still taxiing to the runway.
A queue can hold up to three airplanes at a time. A runway have a cooldown of five
seconds between takeoffs.

GATES
Planes refuel and load passengers while at the gate. A gate can only be used by a
single plane at a time. The name of the gate is displayed next to the gate in
yellow text. A Red label "Reserved" is used to mark the gate as reserved.

TAXIING
The planes taxi from one location to another. During taxiing, the plane is invisible
on the airport map.

WEATHER
Weather conditions are announced with red text. When the announcement
happens, it is recommended to view the runway window and see which
runways are affected. Affected runways should remain closed until the weather
condition ends. There is no announcement, when a weather condition ends but
the ending can be seen from the runway window.

TIP: an airplane can taxi between runways.

INPUT FORMATTING
The user can order planes to land, takeoff and taxi. For taxiing and landings, the
first three digits of the input determine the airplane's flight number. The fourth
digit determines the action, where T stands for taxi and L for landing. The input's
last digits determine the destination: a number of a gate or a name of a runway.

Commanding a takeoff works differently from landing and taxiing. To have a plane
takeoff on a runway, it has to be in the queue. First plane in the queue gets to
takeoff first. To give a plane permission to takeoff, input's first letter must be
"T" followed by the runway's name.

One can type their input on the text field found in the top right corner. Sending
the input happens by pressing the enter key or the button below the text field.

INPUT EXAMPLES
123LR1 -> airplane number 123 should land on runway one
TR1       -> airplane should take off on runway one
123TR1 -> airplane number 123 should taxi to runway one
123TG1 -> airplane number 123 should taxi to gate one

FINAL WORDS
Start the game by closing the instructions and by choosing a scenario! Good luck
and most importantly remember to have fun!
