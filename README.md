# Air Traffic Control Game

The project is an air traffic control game in which the user is responsible for safely managing arriving and departing airplanes. The commands for controlling the planes are introduced after starting the application. This is one of my first programming projects and built in Winter/Spring 2023.

## Technologies

Scala with various libraries. The GUI was built with Swing.


## Project setup

The project can be run

SBT can be used to compile and run the project. The application can be run with the command line by navigating to the root of the project.

Open the SBT terminal:
```
sbt
```
Run the project:
```
run
```

The quality of the GUI depends on the SDK. I recommend OpenJDK 17. I have included a JAR file which can be used to run the project at the root of the ```jar-compatible``` branch, however it has limited functionality.
